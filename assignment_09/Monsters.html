            <p>As the name suggests, this creepy mutant possesses many arms. It is a few heads taller than the regular mutants, and is much stronger than them. It swings its arms around it in a circle to attack. It is also able to destroy buildings and trees with one to two hits, easily penetrating a base camp surrounded by walls. His presence can be easily noticed by his loud roaring and growling, especially in caves.</p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>	In the deeper parts of caves, the player is able to find some malformed mutant babies lying on the ground. They usually appear in tandem with the Virginia, and like other mutants, will start spawning above ground once the player has had enough violent interactions with the cannibals. Their AI seems to function as a homing device to the player, and the babies will crawl towards the player until they are within jumping range. They will then launch themselves violently through the air at the player, dealing a moderate amount of damage upon impact. They can be identified by the distorted baby cries they make as they jump. Luckily, they can be killed with one hit from any weapon.</p>

            <p>The Cowman has two arms and legs, with its most notable feature being that it is extremely overweight. It mostly attacks by charging at the player, changing direction as it charges in an attempt to hit players if they try to move out of the way. Their charge is able to bypass the player's armor, damaging their health as well. It can also jump into the air and perform a bodyslam, heavily damaging the player if caught underneath. It is the rarest of the creepy mutants, being found less often in the caves and less often on the surface until tensions are extremely high between player and mutants. This mutant can usually be heard before it is seen, due to the loud thudding footsteps it takes.</p>

            <p>The Girl mutant is one of the final creepy mutants that is encountered in the game. It can only spawn if the player completes the ending in which they can continue playing. In behaviour and appearance, the Girl mutant is identical to the End Boss, but has instead has the colors of a regular creepy mutant. Its health is less than half of that of the End Boss, but just like it, it is still very difficult to stop at close range. Upon killing the Girl mutant, a single Worm is created and must be dealt with quickly to stop it from multiplying.</p>

            <p>Blue Armsys are identical to their more common counterpart with the exception of greater damage and health. It is possible they may run faster.</p>

            <p>Virginia acts as a sister counterpart to Armsy, having many legs instead of arms. It appears to be three female bodies merged, and has a large vaginal slit from which it is suspected the mutant babies come from. Like the Armsy, it is able to destroy the player's walls and buildings. To attack, it lifts up its front legs and charges the player. It can also jump a certain distance and is able to hit through invisible walls. Contrary to Armsy, Virginia is more silent and difficult to notice aside from her quiet hissing noises. However, her babies can reveal her presence with their crying and squishy jumping sounds.</p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>One of the two most recent mutants added to the game; it only appears after day 40. It is a group of around 30 different entities that have several different forms - the tripod melee/walking form, flying form, tower form, and swarm form. All of the different "links" must be killed individually for it to truly die, otherwise it will multiply itself again. It can destroy all structures very easily, even ones out of reach of normal mutants and cannibals.</p>
